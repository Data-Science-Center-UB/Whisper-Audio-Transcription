SPEAKER_00 (Fieldworker)
[00:00:15] - I bet those men are going to get quite a reception when they get back to earth.

[00:00:53] - What do you sort of imagine for the future? Do you imagine them sending up ships really often and-

[00:01:02] - Uh huh. Because that was such a very small area when you think of it, [00:01:08] that, they just gathered rocks and, and uh, oh, samples of soil and all, [00:01:18] - and they did probe for some samples, and just what's going to come of that [00:01:24] - I don't know. I'd be glad to read it.
