Beam size controls how many alternative transcriptions the model considers at each step (larger values can improve accuracy slightly but make decoding slower).

WhisperX skips confidence-related metrics because its focus is on producing transcriptions with accurate word-level timings, while faster-whisper exposes additional internal information from Whisper."
