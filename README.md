This repository contains materials for the workshop "From Audio to Text: Automated Transcriptions with Whisper" hosted by the Data Science Center (DSC) at the University of Bremen. The materials were developed by Annika Nolte and Nele Fuchs.

The materials contain:

/Notebooks (Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing audio files and conducting transcription including speaker diarization)
/Images (images loaded in the Jupyter notebooks)
/Data (datasets downloaded and loaded in the Jupyter notebooks)
/Results (exemplary transcribed text)

Note that the provided notebooks were created with greatest care, but no guarantee can be given for the correctness of the analyses.
